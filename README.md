### Hi :wave: My name is Gentle 

I am a full-time Software Engineer and NYU graduate. I am most passionate about using my software engineering background to envision technology products that are transparent and empower Black communities. 

I spent the Spring 2020 semester collaborating with the NYU Prison Education Program to research how carceral ideologies, practices, and policies have come to govern nation-state geographies. I explored colonial enclosures and examined the conditions of possibility for materializing new geographies of freedom. Technology functions as a means to mobilize liberation struggles domestically and abroad when we let it. 

I am skilled in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python 3, PHP, Java, React, SQL, R, XCode, iOS, Typescript, Node.js, and more. Every day, I look for new ways to decolonize truthtelling using the technology that connects us as a resource.
