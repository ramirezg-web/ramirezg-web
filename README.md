### Hi :wave: My name is Gentle 

I am a full-time Software Engineer and NYU graduate. I am most passionate about using my software engineering background to envision technology products that are transparent and empower communities. 

I am skilled in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python 3, PHP, Java, React, SQL, R, XCode, iOS, Typescript, Node.js, and more. Every day, I look for new ways to decolonize truthtelling using the technology that connects us as a resource.

Fun Facts: I enjoy gymnastics :cartwheeling:, yoga, and world travel :earth_africa: I've studied abroad in three countries :india: 	:it: :ghana: and touched down in ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡¦ ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¼ ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡¹ ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡²ğŸ‡½ ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡§
