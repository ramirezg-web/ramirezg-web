Hi! My name is Gentle Ramirez

I am a senior at NYU studying Africana Studies, Creative Writing, and Computer Science. I am most passionate about using my software engineering background to envision technology products that are transparent and empower Black communities. 

I have spent the Spring 2020 semester collaborating with the NYU Prison Education Program to research how carceral ideologies, practices, and policies have come to govern nation-state geographies. I explored colonial enclosures and examined what were the conditions of possibility for materializing new geographies of freedom. I believe technology functions as a means to mobilize liberation struggles domestically and abroad when we let it. 

I am the most recent member of the Digital Interest Lab where I explore Public Interest Technology. This is a multi-disciplinary lab centered on human empowerment, informed by history, guided by theory. I am afforded the opportunity to explore the social impact of data science, build capacity in systematic reasoning across deductive and inductive methodologies, and support the Management and Ethics of Data course at NYU Steinhardt.


I am skilled in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python 3, PHP, G-Suite, Microsoft Suite, Retail, Raiser's Edge, Aeon, OOP, cybersecurity, and helpdesk support. Every day, I am looking for new ways to decolonize truthtelling using the technology that connects us as a resource.
